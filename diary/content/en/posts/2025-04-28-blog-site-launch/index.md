Greetings, travelers!

We're excited to announce the launch of our new blog for Goði Sagas: Ísland. This will be the place where we share news, updates, and insights into the development of the game.

Here, you'll be able to follow our progress as we build the world of Ísland, learn about the game's features, and get a closer look at what goes into creating Goði Sagas: Ísland.

We plan to post regularly about various aspects of the game, from the design and mechanics to the art and development process. Whether you're a long-time strategy fan or new to the genre, we hope you'll find something of interest here.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. We look forward to sharing more about Goði Sagas: Ísland with you!

Stay tuned for our next update.
